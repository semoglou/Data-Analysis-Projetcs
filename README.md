# Data Analysis Projects
### Data Analysis and Large-Scale Numerical Linear Algebra projects for MSc in Business Mathematics

This repository showcases data analysis projects and implementations of large-scale numerical linear algebra algorithms. As part of my Master's in Business Mathematics program, these projects explore the intersection of mathematical analysis, business applications, and data-driven insights.

### Projects:

1. **Least Squares Illumination Problem**
2. **SVD Classification of Handwritten Digits**
3. **PageRank in Stanford Web Pages**

Each folder contains an IPython notebook (`*.ipynb`) with the code implementation, an assignment document and an associated data file.
Your feedback and contributions are always appreciated.

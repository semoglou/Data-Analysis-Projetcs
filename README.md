# Data Analysis Projects
### Data Analysis and Large-Scale Numerical Linear Algebra projects for MSc in Business Mathematics

This repository showcases data analysis & machine learning projects and implementations of large-scale numerical linear algebra algorithms. As part of my Master's in Business Mathematics program, these projects explore the intersection of mathematical analysis, business applications, and data-driven insights.

#### Projects:

1. **Least Squares Illumination Problem**
   - Explore the efficient solutions to the least squares illumination problem.

2. **SVD Classification of Handwritten Digits**
   - Implement Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for the classification of handwritten digits, leveraging numerical linear algebra for enhanced accuracy.

3. **PageRank in Stanford Web Pages**
   - Investigate the application of the PageRank algorithm to analyze and rank web pages within the Stanford University dataset.
   - Explore strategies for improving a website's ranking.

Each folder contains an IPython notebook (`*.ipynb`) with the code implementation, an assignment document and an associated data file.

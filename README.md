# Data-Analysis-Projects
Data Analysis and Large-Scale Numerical Linear Algebra projects for MSc in Business Mathematics

This repository showcases data analysis projects and implementations of large-scale numerical linear algebra algorithms. As part of my Master's in Business Mathematics program, these projects explore the intersection of mathematical analysis, business applications, and data-driven insights.

### Project Descriptions:

1. **Least Squares Illumination Problem**
2. **SVD Classification of Handwritten Digits**
3. **PageRank in Stanford Web Pages**

For detailed project descriptions, code, and assignments, please navigate to the corresponding folders. Each folder contains an IPython notebook (`*.ipynb`) with the code implementation and an assignment document.
Your feedback and contributions are always appreciated.

# Data-Analysis-Projects
Data Analysis and Large-Scale Numerical Linear Algebra projects for MSc in Business Mathematics

This repository showcases data analysis projects and implementations of large-scale numerical linear algebra algorithms. As part of my Master's in Business Mathematics program, these projects explore the intersection of mathematical analysis, business applications, and data-driven insights.

### Project Descriptions:

1. **Least Squares Illumination Problem:**
   Explore the application of least squares methods to solve the illumination problem, a common challenge in computer vision. The project aims to efficiently estimate lighting conditions for improved image processing and computer vision applications.

2. **SVD Classification of Handwritten Digits:**
   Utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for the classification of handwritten digits. This project investigates the use of numerical linear algebra techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of digit recognition systems.

3. **PageRank in Stanford Web Pages:**
   Implement the PageRank algorithm to analyze and rank web pages from the Stanford University dataset. This project provides insights into link analysis, network structure, and the significance of individual web pages within a large-scale network.
